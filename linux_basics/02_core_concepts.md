Linux Kernal

### Tasks of Linux Kernal

* Memory Management - It will keep track of how much memory is used to store what and where.
* Process Management - It determines the which process can use the CPU when and how long.
* Device Drivers - It acts as mediator or interpreter between the hardware and processes.
* System calls and security - It receives requests for service from processes.

### Characteristic 

* Monolithic - It means that the kernal carries out CPU scheduling, memory management and several other operations.
* Modular - It means it can extend it's capabilities through the use of dynamic loaded kernel Modules.
 
* $uname - Kernal version
* $uname -r - Details kernel version
* dmesg - generated by kernel while booting
* udevm - find the device connected to system
* lspci - to list out pci devices (USB, Graphic card etc..)
* lsblk - list of block device(HDD)
* lscpu - list the cpu architecture
* lsmem / free -m  - memory . info
* lshw - hardware info

### Linux Boot Sequence.
a. BIOS POst
b. Boot Loader (GRUB 2)
c. Kernel Initialization
d. INIT Process (systemd) -> ls -l /sbin/init to find the type

### Run Levels

runlevel - check operation mode in system

**most common run levels**

|Run Level  | System Targets  |Function | Display Manager Service |
|-------|------|------|-------|
|5| graphical.target | Boots into Graphical Interference | Enabled|
|3| multiuser.target |Boots into CLT | Disabled |

systemctl get-default - current operation mode
(ls -ltr /etc/systemd/system/default.target)
systemctl set-default ( graphical.target / multiuser.target) - to set operation mode.

### Linux file Types

* Regular Files (Images, Scripts etc..)
* Directory ( /root, /home/ajey etc..)
* Special Files 
	+ Character Files (Devices)
	+ Block Files (HDD, RAM Etc.)
	+ Links
		- Hard link
		- Soft link (Like short cut in windows)
	+ Sockets (Communicate two processes)
	+ Named pipes(one process output is input to the another)
	
**Types Identification**

file - to find file types. <br />

or 

ls -ld - first letter is identifier <br />

|File Types  | Identifier |
|-------|------|
|Directory| d |
|Regular File| - |
|Character Device| c |
|Link| l |
|Socket File| s |
|Pipe|  p|
|Block Device| b |

### File System Hierarchy

* /(Root partition)
	+ /bin - Basic commands( cp,mv,rm etc..)
	+ /boot - bootable files
	+ /dev -  Block devices (lsblk)
	+ /etc - configuration files
	+ /home - home directory(except root)
	+ /lib or /lib64 - shared libraries
	+ /media - mount external device (df -hP)
	+ /mnt - mounting 3rd party process (mount)
	+ /opt - 3rd party IDE(integrated development enviornment)
	+ /tmp - temp data
	+ /usr - userland applications & data (Firefox,chrome etc..)
	+ /var - log files

### Labs

* Linux Kernel - Core commands such as lsblk, lscpu, lsmem etc.
* Linux Kernel Modules and Filetypes - Boot modules commands such as systemctl,lshw,lsblk etc.
