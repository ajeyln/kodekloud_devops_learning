These notes have prepared based on [Python Entry Level Programmer Certification ](https://beta.kodekloud.com/lessons/introduction-15/).<br /> 

### Print()

+ Built-in function: can be used without importing it.
+ Allows us to print values to the console.
+ We can invoke it with parentheses.
+ We can pass the value we want to print as arguments between the parentheses.
+ The backslash ** \ ** tell python that the next charecter has special meaning (eg. \n)
+ Keyword argument such as **sep** and **end** can be used to format the output

### Literals

A literals use in order to encode data and put them into code.

#### Types

1. Integers
	* Octal Numbers (Starts with 0o)
	* Hexadecimal numbers (Starts with 0x)
2. Floating point numbers
3. Strings
4. Boolean (0-False, 1-True)

### Arithmetic Operators

There are  7 types of operator
| Operator | Descript | Example |
|-----|-----|-----|
| + | Adition | x + y |
| -  | Subtraction | x - y |
| \*\ | Multiplication | x * y|
| / | Division (Output may be floating value) | x / y|
| // | Floor Division (Output should be Integers) | x // y |
| % | Modules | x % y|
| \*\*\ | Exponential | x \*\*\ y |

### Variables

+ Variables allow to store values
+ A variables has valid name(letters, digits, underscore, non reserved keyword)
+ Python is dynamically type : variables can be redeclared
+ Can use shortcut operators in order to cleanly redeclare a variable
+ can combine text and variables using **+** operator in print function

### Coments

+ comments allow to add information about code
+ A comment is created by a  # followed by text
+ A multiline comment should have a # infront of every line.

### Input()

+ Prompts the user to input some data from console 
+ It accepts an optional parameter that can be used in order to write <br />
 a message before the user input
+ Alway returns a string.

### String Operations

+ Can use + in order to concatenate two strings
+ Can use \* in order to repeat a string a several amount of times.
+ With the str function, can type-cast a number into string
